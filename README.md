## Problem
Problem
A major impediment to overcoming the global skills gap in ML/AI is access to compute resources at scale and the energy required to sustain those computations.  The training of ever-more-sophisticated multi-parametric machine learning models can take hours to complete, and with a terrible carbon emissions footprint.  The present teaching methodology of repeated training and re-training of ML/AI models is increasingly infeasible.  Solutions to this problem are needed to broadly enable the training of ML/AI practitioners, especially in low- and middle-income countries.  We have implemented (Figure 1-1) a system allowing learners to access pre-trained models stored in the public cloud and accessible securely and at global scale.
